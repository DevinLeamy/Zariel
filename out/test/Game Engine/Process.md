First thing I needed to do was install the latest Java JDK
and with IntelliJ IDEA. 

Next, I installed LWJGL. LWJGL contains Java language bindings for OpenGL and 
GLFW, two APIs commonly used for OpenGL development. LWJGL affectively lets you
use OpenGL within Java.


LWJGL Version:  3.3.1
GLSL  Version:  4.10
OpenGL Version: 4.1

### Day 1
