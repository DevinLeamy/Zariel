First thing I needed to do was install the latest Java JDK
and with IntelliJ IDEA. 

Next, I installed LWJGL. LWJGL contains Java language bindings for OpenGL and 
GLFW, two APIs commonly used for OpenGL development. LWJGL affectively lets you
use OpenGL within Java.

### Day 1
- Created a number of boilerplate files.
- Got a triangle rendering to the screen.
- Created a Trello board for the project.
